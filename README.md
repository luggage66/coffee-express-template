coffee-express-template
=======================

# Clone repo
# install grunt-cli if you don't already have it `npm install grunt-cli -g`
# Run `npm install`
# Run `grunt dev`

That will compile coffeescript from `src/` into `lib/`, start the web server, and watch for changes (recompiling and restarting as needed).
